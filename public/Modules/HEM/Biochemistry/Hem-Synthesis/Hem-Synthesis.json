],
"correctAnswer": "By inducing ALA synthase and/or cytochrome P450, increasing demand for heme and precursors",
"explanation": "A large number of drugs (e.g., barbiturates, sulfonamides) induce the ALA synthase and/or induce cytochrome P450, which uses up heme. In patients with porphyria, increased activities of ALA synthase result in increased levels of potentially harmful heme precursors prior to the metabolic block. Thus, taking drugs that cause induction of cytochrome P450... can precipitate attacks of porphyria.",
